# Modbus Example

In this example, XRT is used to communicate with a Modbus TCP/IP Device ([Damocles2 Mini](https://www.hw-group.com/device/damocles2-mini)
or Modbus Simulator), reading data values which are then
sent to its Azure IoT Hub device twin. Via the
device twin, commands can also be sent back to the Modbus Device.

![Azure Sphere Modbus Example](images/AzureSphereModbusExample.jpg)

The example reads the digital input from the Modbus device via
the Modbus Device Service component and publishes the data onto
the internal XRT bus. A Lua Scripting component subscribes to
these values and checks for any digital input states changes.

A Lua Scripting component subscribes to these values and check
to see if the state now different from the previous state. When
the new state is different from the previous, it will be pushed
to the Azure IoT Hub via a Azure Export component, However, if the state
hasn't changed, the state won't be pushed to the Azure IoT Hub. The
reason for this method to stop the same unchanged state being
repeatedly sent to the IoT Hub.

From the Azure IoT Hub methods can be called on Device Twins
to send commands back down to the XRT running on the Azure Sphere
hardware to set the digital output values. Command values are
received by the Azure Export component and published onto the XRT
bus. The Modbus Device Service subscribes to these commands and
sets the value of the two digital outputs on the Damocles2 Mini.

*Note - The digital outputs on the device are wired to the digital
inputs on the device. In this way output values are automatically
mirrored by the digital inputs.*

## Hardware

### Azure Sphere

This example uses a Azure Sphere Guardian 100 Module.
The Guardian 100 is a wireless edge module that uses
Azure Sphere to deliver secure connectivity to devices.

It includes Avnet Azure Sphere MT3620 module and connects
to existing equipment via Ethernet or USB. Guardian-enabled
devices also receive automatic security updates through the
Azure Sphere Security Service.

### Modbus Device

The [Damocles2 Mini](https://www.hw-group.com/device/damocles2-mini)
is a smart I/O controller used for remote monitoring and
control of sensors and devices. It provides 4 digital dry
contact inputs and 2 digital relay outputs that can be
accessed via a Modbus interface.

If you do not have access to a physical device a Java
Modbus simulator called ModbusPal, can be used instead of the
real hardware.

If the Damocles hardware is used then it must be connected to
the Guardian 100 module via a wired Ethernet connection.

If the simulator is used it can be installed on your PC and accessed
via either wired Ethernet or WiFi.

## Prerequisites

*Note - The prerequisites found on the main
[readme.md](../README.md) are also required for this example.*

* Either [ModbusPal](https://iotech.jfrog.io/artifactory/public/ModbusPal.jar)
  Java Modbus simulator, or a Damocles2 Mini connected by
  wired EtherNet to a Guardian 100 module
* Azure IoT Hub setup with your claimed Azure Sphere Module
* Telnet is installed on Ubuntu or enabled on Windows
  (unless debugging via Visual Studio)
* Connected to host via a micro-USB cable. Note to access this port
      the top casing must be removed

## Configuration

In-order for the Modbus Example to work, you will need
to edit some of the configurations listed below.

### Device Profile

To connect to a new device via XRT you must first create a
Device Profile for the specific device type.

Device Profiles and DTDL for Digital Twins files can created
using IOTechâ€™s [Device Configuration Tool](https://dct.iotechsys.com/).
A video showing you how to do this can for the Damocles2 Mini device
can be viewed at [DCT Modbus Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1hC7S4uE4).

The configuration files generated from the tool are provided
as follows:
*	[Damocles2 Mini Device Profile](../config/profiles/Damocles2-Mini.json)
*	[Damocles2 Mini DTDL file](../Damocles2-Mini.dtdl)

### Device Service

* Edit the [config/modbus.json](../config/modbus.json) file and 
  replace 10.0.0.1 with the IP address of your Modbus Device
  (If your using ModbusPal Simulator, this should be the
  IP Address of the machine currently running the
  Simulator)

![Device Service Config](images/DeviceServiceConfig.svg)  

### Azure

To connect the example to your IoT Hub endpoint you must also
configure Azure Export Service component.

* Edit [config/azure.json](../config/azure.json) and the value
  for the "HostName", "DeviceID" and "ScopeID" values.

* The DeviceID can be found for a USB connected device with
  the command:

```bash
azsphere device list-attached
```

* The HostName is the IOT Hub host name and can be found using
  the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or using the
  command (replace HubName with the name of your IOT hub):

```bash
az iot hub show --name HubName | grep hostName
```

* The Device Provisioning Service ID Scope can be found using
  the portal or the command (replace DPSName with the name of
  your Device Provisioning Service):

```bash
az iot dps show --name DPSName | grep idScope
```

![Azure Export Config](images/AzureExportConfig.svg)

### App Manifest 

Edit the [app_manifest.json](../app_manifest.json) file and
replace 10.0.0.1 with the IP address of your PC, set
DeviceAuthentication to your tenant id and replace
IOTechHub with your IoT Hub name in AllowedConnections:

```bash
azsphere tenant list
```

## Using A ModbusPal Simulator With The Example

 To use ModbusPal Simulator with this example you will
 need to:

* Download the [ModbusPal.jar](https://iotech.jfrog.io/artifactory/public/ModbusPal.jar) file.

* Run the simulator by clicking on download (Windows) or
  with the command:

```bash
java -jar ModbusPal.jar
```

* Use the "Load" button and select the [damocles.xmpp](damocles.xmpp)
  file. This provides a simulation of a simple Modbus
  devices with 4 binary inputs and two binary outputs.

![ModbusPal Load](images/ModbusPalLoad.svg)

* Start the simulator with the "Run" button
Configuring XRT for use with Guardian 100 or Modbus simulator
In order to deploy the example application and enable it
connect to the Modbus simulator (or a real Damocles2 Mini device) 
then you must configure the following config files for the
XRT Modbus Device Service component and the Azure Sphere manifest
to use the IP address of your PC.

* [Deploy and Debug with Ubuntu](ubuntu-deploy-deploy.md)

## Inputs & Outputs With A Modbus Device

This section explains how to change:
* Change the Output states from the IoT Hub in the Cloud
* Change the Input states of a simulated device with ModbusPal.

With a real Modbus Device, the input states will be changed by the
device and that state change will be pushed up to the IoT Hub in the
Cloud. However, if your using ModbusPal Simulator, you will need to
change the Input States from the UI to simulate a Input State change,
that will then be sent up to the IoT Hub in the Cloud.

Make sure that you've deployed XRT to Azure Sphere hardware to
see changes taking place with the IoT Hub in the Cloud.

#### Changing A Modbus Device Input State On ModbusPal Simulator

*Note - Only follow this section if your using ModbusPal Simulator
and an actual Modbus Device.*  

* Open the Slave Editor by pressing the button with the "eye" icon and
  then select the "Coils" tab in the dialog that appears.

![Open Slave Editor](images/ModbusPalEye.svg)

![Select Coils](images/ModbusPalCoils.svg)

* Change the value of "Input 1" by double clicking in the table value
  entry and entering a value of "1".

![Change Value](images/ModbusPalChangeValue.svg)

* Observe the debug output to see the new value being read from the
  simulated Modbus device and then published to the Azure Cloud.

#### Changing A Modbus Device Output State

This section applies to a simulated device and a real device.

The script update.sh can be used to update device resources in the Azure
IoT hub to invoke a device method.

* To set the resource BinaryOutput1 to true issue the command (replace
  IotHub-Name with the name of your IoT Hub):

```bash
./update.sh <IotHub-Name> BinaryOutput1 true
```
