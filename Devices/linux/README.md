# Linux Device Example

## Example

This example uses the linux device component to determine metrics for the target linux device, such as CPU and memory utilisation.

**Run XRT with the config folder:**

This is assuming that the following pre-requisites are satisfied:

* XRT is installed
* LD_LIBRARY_PATH has been correctly set
* XRT_LICENSE_FILE has been set to the location of the xrt license

```bash
$ /path/to/xrt/executable/xrt /path/to/xrt-examples/Devices/linux/config
```
